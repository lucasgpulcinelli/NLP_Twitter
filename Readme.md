# NLP Twitter

This jupyter notebook is a demonstration of sentiment analysis of tweets using tensorflow in various ways, including by the usage of the pretrained BERT model, in an attempt to increase the F1-Score of the validation samples.

The objective of this repository is to learn about how to create neural networks for natural language processing and import existing trained models from tensorflow hub.

The dataset in data/NLP_data_raw.csv comes from a kaggle competition.
